BPMN 2.0 Aufarbeitung

# Short Summary

Business Process Model Notation, or BPMN for short,  
is a way of visualizing complex business processes.


The most innovative feature is the horizontal representation of the process flow by time and

the vertical arrangement of the process steps according to the areas of responsibility involved in the process.

This enables a unique clarity of even the most complicated processes and thus creates the prerequisite for a sustainable understanding of the processes and their optimization and standardization.
